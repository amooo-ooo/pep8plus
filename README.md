# pep8plus

pep8plus is an online tool built for educational institutions to help students enforce and maintain Python programming standards. Powered by Ruff, Flake8 and Pylint, pep8plus is built on the principle of customisability, ease of use and user experience. The purpose of this project is to provide educators with a transparent, customisable and easy solution to helping their students enforce Python conventions. 

## Features

Here are a few major features of pep8plus: 

- Automatic Solutions:
pep8plus offers direct solutions  improving your code to convention.
- Customisation:
pep8plus offers three different popular linters: Ruff, Pylint and Flake8. With over 1000 built-in convention guides and rules combined, all convention settings are able to be easily activated and deactivated to share with students.
- Shareability:
pep8plus allows educators to easily share customised convention settings to their students by generating a custom link.

and more!

## Colours
Each convention rule is colour coded to their severity.

| Colour        | Severity          | Description                                                          | 
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `red`         | `error`           | There is an error or some sort of issue with the code.               |
| `light red`   | `syntax-error`    | There is a significant error on syntax that needs to be fixed.       |
| `yellow`      | `severe-warning`  | There is a high priority issue with the code's syntax.               | 
| `orange`      | `warning`         | There is an issue with the code's syntax.                            |
| `purple`      | `complex`         | Complex issues. (For more experienced developers)                    |
| `dark purple` | `super-complex`   | Harder complex issues. (For more experienced developers)             |
| `cyan`        | `neutral`         | Low priority opiniated, neutral issues.                              |
