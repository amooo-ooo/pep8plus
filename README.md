# pep8plus
pep8plus is an online tool to help Python enthusiasts of all levels enforce and maintain python coding standards. Powered by Ruff, Flake8 and Pylint, pep8plus is built on the principle of customisability, ease of use and user experience. The project is originally developed for educational institutions, in order to provide educators with a transparent, customisable and easy solution to helping their students enforce Python conventions. 

## Features

There are several key features pep8plus has which differentiates from other online checkers. 

- Customisation: 
pep8plus allows educators to select enforced rules from three different linters, Ruff, Pylint and Flake8. With over 1000 built-in convention rules combined, all convention settings are able to be easily activated and deactivated to share with students.
- Shareability:
pep8plus allows educators and teachers to easily share customised convention rule settings to their students by generating a custom link.
- Suggestions:
pep8plus offers direct suggestions and solutions to improving your code to convention.
- Open Source:
With the project being open-source, pep8plus allows educational institutions to self-host the program and build their own plugins 
- Live Code Editor:
